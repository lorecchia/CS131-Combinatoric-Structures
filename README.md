CS131
=====

These are lecture notes for Computer Science 131, _Combinatoric Structures,_ as taught by me at Boston University in Spring 2017.

The notes are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.   Demos and most figures are included as executable Python code. 

Each notebook can be presented as a slideshow using the very nice
package "Live Reveal", https://github.com/damianavila/RISE, by
@damianavila.  This is how I give the lectures, typically modifying the
code during the lecture to illustrate points or explore ideas that come up.

Lecture notes are also available in pdf, as converted using nbconvert.


#### Acknowledgements
I have adapted this notebook setup from Mark Crovella's [CS132 - Geometric Structures](https://github.com/mcrovella/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms), also available on GitHub.
