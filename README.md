CS132
=====

These are lecture notes for Computer Science 132, _Geometric
Algorithms,_ as taught by me at Boston University.
* Fall 2015 - current version.  This semester the materials were
  converted to Python 3.4 and the 5th edition of the text.  This set is
  available as the "Fall 2015 Final" release.
* Spring 2015 (4th edition of text, Python 2.7 code) - available as the
  "spring15-final" release

This course is based on _Linear Algebra and its Applications,_ by David
C. Lay, Addison-Wesley (Pearson).

The notes are in the form of ipython notebooks.   Demos and most figures
are included as executable Python code. 

Each notebook can be presented as a slideshow using the very nice
package "Live Reveal", https://github.com/damianavila/RISE, by
@damianavila.  This is how I give the lectures, typically modifying the
code during the lecture to illustrate points or explore ideas that come up.

Lecture notes are also available in pdf, as converted using nbconvert.

A separate set of questions, used for in-class peer instruction with clickers, are
available on request.
