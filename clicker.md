# How to Obtain and Set Up a Student Response Device

Every student is required to have a TurningTechnologies [student-response device](device.html) and license. Please read ALL of the following instructions before you buy one.

- If you already have a student-response device and a license, jump straight to the [Registration Instructions](clickerreg.html). Otherwise, continue reading.

- If you have an iPhone, Android Phone, or portable device with an internet browser:  
	I suggest you use the ResponseWare App to turn your device into a student-response device. Although the app itself is free, it does not work unless you buy a One-Year ResponseWare license ($20.99) directly from TurningTechnologies. To do that, you must first create a TurningTechnologies user account. If you expect to take other courses that use student response devices in future years (for example, biology and chemistry) you may wish to buy a 4-year license.

	Instructions to create an account and buy a license are listed [here](clickerreg.html).

- If you do NOT have (or do not want to use) a portable device:  
	Then, you should buy a TurningTechnologies RF-LCD student-response card (clicker) with a license. The clicker works by itself, without a smartphone or other device. If you decide to buy a clicker, I strongly suggest that you buy a new RF-LCD ResponseCard at the BU Bookstore. Buying a new clicker from the Bookstore has several important advantages: you get the clicker immediately, it cannot get lost in the mail, and if it stops working (a common problem), you can exchange it at the Bookstore for another one (be sure to keep your BU Bookstore clicker receipt in a safe place). Keep in mind that only the RF-LCD clicker model can be used in this course. I don’t recommend used clickers – they often stop working because of dead batteries or because of other problems, and the bookstore will not exchange them when they fail.

In order to get credit for using your clicker in class, you will have to register it on BlackBoard and activate the license. Instructions are contained [here](clickerreg.html).
