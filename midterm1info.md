The midterm will take place in class, from 3.30pm to 4.45pm.

## Material covered

- Everything from Lectures 1-6. Lecture notes are available on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/bu/spring2017/cs131/resources).
- Tuesday's Lecture 7 will finish up the topic of nested quantifiers. This will be included in the midterm. Everyhting else from Lecture 7 will not be on the midterm.
- From the textbook (Rosen):
	- Chapter 1.1: Propositional Logic;
	- Chapter 1.3: Propositional Equivalencs; up to page 30. Stop at the heading Propositional Satisfiability;
	- Chapter 1.4: Predicates and Quantifiers; up to page 51. Stop at Logic Programming.
	- Chapter 1.5: Nested Quantifiers.

Of course, reading some of non-required material may help you gain familiarity with the subject and prove useful in the midterm, so you are encouraged to extend your readings beyond the list above.


## Practice 

### Exercises

The book contains a large number of exercises for you to try out. 

**SOLUTIONS POLICY**: Feel free to discuss on Piazza solutions to **ODD-NUMBERED** questions in the Rosen textbook. If you are unsure about your solutio to an odd-numbered question, you should ask your peers and the teaching staff on Piazza. You can also ask the teaching staff at tutoring hours for help with any exercise you are trying.

### Practice Midterm

On Tuesday, I will put out a practice midterm and its solution. This is supposed to represent more closely the scope and difficulty of the actual midterm.

### Labs 

The labs will be dedicated to reviewing material for the midterm. The TF will answer questions and work through the solutions of some exercises based on the Piazza discussions.


## A bit of advice on preparing for the midterm

The book presents many examples of the basic concepts of logic. These are intended to gradually familiarize you with these concepts and their usage. However, you do __NOT__ need to know these examples. All you _need to know_ are the definitions of the basic concepts and all you _need to be able to do_ is to put these definitions in use, on any reasonable example, no matter how different from those in the book. Please focus on understanding, not on memorizing. Practice is the best way to build understanding: do not plan to read all the book chapters first and then practice. Try out exercises as you go.
