Click the link, and you will be redirected to a login page for TurningTechnologies.   

> YOU MUST GO TO THE TURNINGPOINT SITE FROM THE BLACKBOARD LINK. DO NOT NAVIGATE TO THE PAGE DIRECTLY.

Enter the device number on the back of your clicker (it will be six hexadecimal values). Click ‘Register’ to activate the clicker.

#### Registering a License

To register a license, go back to the main dashboard screen (as seen above), and click the icon to the left labeled ‘License’. This will bring you to the license registration page. Once you are on that page, click the box with the ‘+’ icon and ‘Add a License’. Enter the license code on the piece of paper given to you when you were given a clicker. Click ‘Redeem’ to activate the License.

#### Purchasing a License Directly from TurningPoint

To purchase a license on its own, navigate to the main TurningPoint screen or click the link titled ‘Dashboard’. On the left portion of the screen, you should see several links on the toolbar. Click the link titled ‘Student Store’ and follow the instructions to purchase a license.
