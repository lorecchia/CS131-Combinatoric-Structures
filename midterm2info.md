# Information for Midterm 2: 3/28/2017
Last updated: Sunday 3/23 at 12:20pm.

## Logistics:
The midterm will take place in class, from 3.30pm to 4.45pm.   
	- You will have space to solve the exercises on the exam booklet, so no extra paper is needed.  
	- No cheatsheets or index cards allowed.  
	- Please write in pen, not pencil.  
	- Please make a note of your CS131 ID number, the one you use for homework. You will have to use the same number to identify your midterm.  
	
### Special accomodations
If you are entitled to a special accomodation for taking the exam, please notify the instructor and the TF by email by the end of Friday 3/24. 

## Material covered

- Everything from Lectures 9-12. See lecture schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zU7A5lqDNNbJVjETO6XPas3sM0HMOGMlxghBtLTOz0/edit#gid=0). The basics of Strong Induction from Lecture 13.
- From the textbook (Rosen):
	- Chapter 1.7: Intro to Proofs.
	- Chapter 1.8: Proof Methods and Strategy.
	- Chapter 2.4: Sequences and Summation.
	- Chapter 5.1: Mathematical Induction.
	- Chapter 5.2: Strong Induction and Well-Ordering.

Of course, reading some of non-required material may help you gain familiarity with the subject and prove useful in the midterm, so you are encouraged to extend your readings beyond the list above.


## Practice 

### Exercises

The book contains a large number of exercises for you to try out. 

**SOLUTIONS POLICY**: Feel free to discuss on Piazza solutions to **ODD-NUMBERED** questions in the Rosen textbook. If you are unsure about your solutio to an odd-numbered question, you should ask your peers and the teaching staff on Piazza. You can also ask the teaching staff at tutoring hours for help with any exercise you are trying.

### Practice Midterm

On Thursday, I will put out a practice midterm and its solution. This is supposed to represent more closely the scope and difficulty of the actual midterm.

### Special Offie Hours

The following office hours will run this week in preparation to Midterm 2 on Tuesday. All office hours are in the Undegraduate Lab, unless specified otherwise:  
* Friday: Jiadong  2-3.30pm; Hannah 3.30pm-5pm.   
* Monday: Lorenzo 12-1pm in Lorenzo's office, Sarah 2-4pm.   
* Tuesday: Hannah 11-12.30pm.  
 
## A bit of advice on preparing for the midterm

As usual, practice is the best way to build understanding: do not plan to read all the book chapters first and then practice. Try out exercises as you go. This is especially true for proofs: try to prove a variety of theorems; when you prove a theorem by a certain technique, ask yourself whether it could be proved using a different strategy; check your proofs -- are you making any logical mistakes?
